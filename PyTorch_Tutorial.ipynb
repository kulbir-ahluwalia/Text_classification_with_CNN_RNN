    "- We create a new class named `SimpleCNN`, which inherited from `nn.Module` (a built-in class from Pytorch).\n",
    "- The model below consists of an `__init__()` portion which is where you **include the layers and components of the neural network**. In our model, we have a convolutional layer denoted by `nn.Conv2d(...)`. We are dealing with an image dataset that is in a grayscale so we only need one channel going in, hence `in_channels=1`. We hope to get a nice representation of this layer, so we use `out_channels=32`. Kernel size is 3, and for the rest of parameters we use the default values which you can find [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html#torch.nn.Conv2d). \n",
    "- After the convolutional layer, we have a flatten operation on the incoming data, which will transform the tensor into a one-dimensional tensor by specifying the `start_dim` and `end_dim`. Here, we transform the tensor to a size of `(1, 26*26*32)`. If you would like to find out how to calculate those numbers refer to [this](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.flatten.html?highlight=flatten#torch.flatten). \n",
    "- We use two back-to-back **dense layers** to the incoming data. Notice for `d1` we have a dimension 128 representing the size we want as output and `26*26*32` representing the dimension of the incoming data. In short, the dense layer transforms the input data into a specific dimension. The same applies for the second linear transformation (`d2`) where the dimension of the output of the previous linear layer was added as `in_features=128`, and `10` is just the size of the output which also corresponds to **the number of classes**.\n",
    "- After each one of those layers, we also apply an **activation function** such as `ReLU`. `ReLu` is a common and useful function for activation. The output has the same shape as the input. For prediction purposes, we then apply a `softmax` layer to the last transformation and return the output of that. If you want to know the math in these operations, you can search [Pytorch Doc](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html).\n",
    "- *Forword Pass* refers to the **calculation process**, values of the output layers from the inputs data. It's traversing through all neurons from first to last layer.\n",
    "- *Backward Pass* refers to the **counting changes in weights**, using **gradient descent algorithm **(or similar). Computation is made from last layer, backward to the first layer.\n"
